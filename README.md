PircBotX 2.0.1 listeners/irc functions

-  Some functions I wrote for my IRC bot known as Wheatley, who currently runs more advanced versions of the functions. 
-  These functions and Wheatley as a whole are my first time coding in Java, so they're not the greatest, but the do function
-  I still wanted to keep the functions, so they're now in here
-  all functions are standalone listeners, and can be added by adding .addListener(new listener())
-  all games require wordlist.txt except Bomb, which requires colorlist.txt
